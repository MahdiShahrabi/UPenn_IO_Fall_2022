For models (1), (2), and (3), variables on left columns respectively reflect first, second, third differences.

\subsection{What does it say about measurement error?}
From Griliches and Hausman (1986), if variables are serially correlated, and there is a measurement error in the inputs, the shorter-difference estimates will be biased toward zero. The fact that the 5, 10, and 15 years difference estimators report different coefficients tells us that there probably was a measurement error in the inputs in lemp and ldnpt. Also
