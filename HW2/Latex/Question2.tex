\subsection{(d)}

As shown in Table 2, the results are almost same in all three specifications. This might be interpreted as additional information brought from exit decisions can substitute for the usual inversion of the investment decision function. Also, the results in Tables 2 and 3 are intuitive. The coefficient on labor is 0.584, and the coefficient on capital is around 0.379. These results are very similar to the results from specification (3) from Problem 1 â€” the specification that modeled transmitted shocks as AR processes. We can conclude that allowing for a more general process than AR does not add much. And as we have seen in problem 1, allowing for fixed effects even creates additional problems.
